        Main view handler since all SQRL requests are ``POST`` requests.

        This method does not implement a lot of logic. It mostly relies on other
        methods which it then orchestrates. For information on what responsibilities
        which method has, you can take a look at :obj:`.SQRLAuthView` description.

        Some implementation details worth mentioning:

        * This method uses multiple forms to validate different sections of the payload.
          Specifically it uses :obj:`.forms.AuthQueryDictForm` to validate the presence
          of ``?nut=`` within querystring; and :obj:`.forms.RequestForm` to validate
          the SQRL payload itself.
        * This method extensively uses :obj:`.exceptions.TIFException` to immediately
          return some sort of error to the user which is handled by :meth:`.dispatch`.
          The only exception to that is that it still raises ``Http404`` when nut pattern
          is not validated. Normally in Django that would of been validated in url patterns
          however since SQRL forces to use ``?nut=`` querystring, we mimic same behaviour
          404 Not Found in the view.
        * To atomically process all SQRL commands (all or nothing), this view
          implements all SQRL commands as dedicated methods (e.g. :meth:`.query`).
          That allows this method to find all appropriate handlers for all the commands
          and if not all are found, :obj:`.exceptions.TIFException` can be raised
          with :attr:`.exceptions.TIF.NOT_SUPPORTED` bit set as ``True``.
          If all are found, then it simply processes them in the order they were requested.
        * Since any SQRL command can potentially fail, none of the SQRL command handlers
          save any state in either the session or models because other commands can fail
          after them. If all succeed, this method then explicitly finalizes/saves all the
          state which includes session and models.
